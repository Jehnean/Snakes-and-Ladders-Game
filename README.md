###Project Workflow: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

Yes - Created User stories: 

As a player, I want to know how to play the game so I can formulate a strategy to win. 
As a player, I want to know the criteria for winning the game. 
As a player, I want to know the rules so I know what I can and can’t do. 
As a player, I want at least one opponent to play against. 

As a player, I want to be able to reset the game so I can start over.
As a player, I want to be able to see all the pieces on the board so I can see where I rank. 
As a player, I want to be able to clearly see which piece is mine. 
As a player, I want to roll the dice so I can move forward. 
As a player, I want to see who has won. 
As a player, I want be notified if the game has ended, and who won. 
As a player, I want to land on ladder spaces to advance more quickly. 
As a player, I want to avoid snake spaces to so I don’t fall behind. 


###Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Yes - Render a game in the browser
Yes - Design logic for winning & visually display which player won 
Yes - Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Yes - Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Yes - Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Yes - Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it (there will be a quick tutorial on this later in the week)
Yes - Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

###Creativity: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

Created a working Snakes and Ladders game. Though, I feel the UX would benefit from several more features. 

###Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

Tried to follow best preactices in the code 

###Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

Yes
