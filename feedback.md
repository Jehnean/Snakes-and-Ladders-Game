* **2** Exceeds expectations

| | Score | Commentary |
|---|---|---|
| **Project WorkFlow** | 2 | Great job writing granular user stories and consciously wire-framing your final project before starting to code. It shows that you put a lot of thought and planning into this project by how well-defined and polished the final product was. Nice job committing frequently!  |
| **Technical Requirements** | 1 | This project demonstrates a solid knowledge of web technologies and how you are able to synthesize them together to make a cohesive product. More specifically, you exhibited a good understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, working with the DOM, and organizing yourself through a project. Nice one! |
| **Creativity** | 1.5 | It that you knew what you wanted to build and that it was scoped appropriately to the skills you came into the project with. The final product is visually appealing and well-refined.  You were also forced to think through some creative solutions in order to set up the board and write the game logic. |
| **Code Quality** | 1.5 | Your code is easy to understand as it is well-named, appropriately commented, and arranged logically. Organizing the board state into an object was a good design choice. Defining the functions in your application and then calling them on page load (at the bottom of the page) is also good practice. Happy with this! |
| **Problem Solving** | 1 | You possess the ability to breakdown a problem into smaller pieces, solve each and synthesize them back together into a final product. Over time you will develop more confidence in your this process to do this quicker. I appreciate you coming to me for help, but I believe you processed the answers without knowing it. Bouncing ideas off of others or writing them down first can be helpful. You are very organized and that will be a major benefit moving forward. |
